          Back in 1954, a man named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California, and wrote the first page of our history. 
          <br />
          <br />
          From humble beginnings as a small restaurant, we're proud to have become one of the world's leading food service brands with more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.

          All our products are made with fresh, natural ingredients of the best quality to bring the best food to the table or to your favorite place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Top quality has always been our approach to food, and because chicken is at the center of our menu, that means serving only whole, boneless breasts of chicken â€“ no fillers or artificial preservatives. We source our chicken from farms in the USA, in accordance with our Animal Wellbeing Standards, and our pledge to source No Antibiotics Ever chicken.
